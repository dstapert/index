                <h3>Weather Website</h3>
                <p>I completed this website for a school project. The aim is to use a weather API, in this case, 
                    I used <a href="https://www.visualcrossing.com/" target="_blank">Visual Crossing</a> to interact and display weather data to the user based on user location/input. Feel free to check it out with the link below.</p>

                <h3>Name Generator</h3>
                <p>This project was a fun little side project that can display names or even usernames. 
                    I am awful at thinking up interesting online usernames or names, so I can use this to 
                    think of cool usernames/names to use.</p>

                <h3>AutoPress</h3>
                <p>AutoPress is an autoclicker/macro application made with WinForms and C#. 
                    The autoclicker has a ton of customization. Things you can customize are the interval, 
                    input type, hold interval, random relative position and random click timing to name a few. 
                    You can write out and/or record mouse/keyboard actions with the built-in macro editor and then 
                    save and play them.</p>

                <h3>Color Picker</h3>
                <p>After running into a hurdle with getting colors in WinForms, created an 
                    application that grabs colors from cursor. Also supports manual inputs through RGB/Hex.</p>

                <h3>Conversions</h3>
                <p>Conversions was made due to my interest in converting imperial to metric with my weather website, 
                    but I soon thought up of many other conversions that I could do. Conversions such as text to binary 
                    and vice versa. Some units that this webpage can convert are binary, hexadecimal, morse code and 
                    metric/imperial lengths and weights currently.</p>
